# Thank You!

Thank you for working through the workshop today. We hope that you found it to be useful in getting started with client-side encryption using the AWS Encryption SDK and AWS KMS.

# Cleaning Up

There are helper scripts available to help you completely tear down your stack resources.

## Emptying Your Document Bucket

To remove the contents of your test S3 bucket so that CloudFormation can completely delete the stack, do the following:

```bash
cd ~/environment/workshop/cdk
make data_purge
```

## Deleting Your Document Bucket Resource Stacks

After emptying your Document Bucket, you can now use CDK to destroy your stack.

```bash
cd ~/environment/workshop/cdk
cdk destroy BusyEngineer*
```

## Shutting Down Cloud9

Use the CloudFormation console to delete your Cloud9 stack.

1. <a href="https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#" target="_blank">Open the Cloud9 Console</a>
1. Select the "BusyEngineersDocumentBucketEnvironment" stack
1. Press "Delete"

## Finished!

That's it! Your workshop resources have been torn down.
