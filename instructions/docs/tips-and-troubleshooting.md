# Tips and Troubleshooting

This page contains reference information that might be useful as you work through the workshop.

## Troubleshooting

### Errors with configuration

If you are getting a `NullPointerException` (Java), or a `KeyError` (Python), or similar errors when interacting with the TOML files (config and state), try running the state generation step again to make sure the file is generated and well formed.

```bash
# Check the contents of your state file
cat ~/.busy_engineers_state.toml

# Regenerate your state file, if needed
cd ~/environment/workshop/cdk/
make state
```

Now try your work again.

### Automated code checks

These commands will check your code for missing imports, syntax issues, and other minor issues that might trip you up.

```bash tab="Java"
mvn verify
```

```bash tab="JavaScript Node.JS"
npm run prettier
```

```bash tab="TypeScript Node.JS"
npm run prettier
```

```bash tab="Python"
tox -e check
```

### Missing CloudFormation resources

Make sure you take the defaults for which region to launch in (us-east-2). If you've changed the region for any part of the workshop, tear your stack down and start fresh.

### More disk space on Cloud9

Working through the workshop, you might find that you are out of disk. If this happens, use the following script to expand your EBS volume. (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/move-environment.html#move-environment-resize" target="_blank">Script source</a>)

Note that this is adapted from the script source because the Busy Engineer's Cloud9 instances run on EC2 Nitro, which has different block device identifiers.

Step by step:

1. Save the script below to `resize.sh`
1. `chmod +x resize.sh`
1. `./resize.sh`
  * By default, this will increase your volume to 20GB, but you may supply a different number if you prefer.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the desired volume size in GiB as a command-line argument. If not specified, default to 20 GiB.
SIZE=${1:-20}

# Install the jq command-line JSON processor.
sudo yum -y install jq

# Get the ID of the envrionment host Amazon EC2 instance.
INSTANCEID=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data//instance-id)

# Get the ID of the Amazon EBS volume associated with the instance.
VOLUMEID=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-id $INSTANCEID | jq -r .Reservations[0].Instances[0].BlockDeviceMappings[0].Ebs.VolumeId)

# Resize the EBS volume.
aws ec2 modify-volume --volume-id $VOLUMEID --size $SIZE

# Wait for the resize to finish.
while [ "$(aws ec2 describe-volumes-modifications --volume-id $VOLUMEID --filters Name=modification-state,Values="optimizing","completed" | jq '.VolumesModifications | length')" != "1" ]; do
  sleep 1
  done

# Rewrite the partition table so that the partition takes up all the space that it can.
sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1p1 1

# Expand the size of the file system.
sudo resize2fs /dev/nvme0n1p1
```

## Tips

### API Documentation

Python and Java have API documentation available for each exercise. You can view the documentation as you work in Cloud9.

```bash tab="Java"
make javadoc
```

```bash tab="Python"
tox -e docs
```

Now select "Preview -> Preview Running Application" from the Cloud9 menu bar.

Cloud9 will open a new pane in your IDE with a web browser rendering your API documentation.

### Cloud9

Cloud9 has lots of IDE features for you to leverage. Here's some links to help you make the most of your Cloud9 experience. (Links all open in a new window.)

### Cryptographic Details

The Busy Engineer's Document Bucket only scratches the surface of the features offered by AWS KMS.
